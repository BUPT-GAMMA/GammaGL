We notice that the calculation of SpCo part is disentangled with the target model. That's to say, SpCo part does not include parameters needed to optimize with target model together. Therefore, we calculate the results of SpCo on PubMed aforehand, because of the big size of PubMed. Then, for each target model, we select several intermediate results in order. "0.01_1_9.npz" means we set "epsilon=0.01" and "sin_iter=1", then we run SpCo to generate 10 $\Delta A$ and this file is the 10th result.
